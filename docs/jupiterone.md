# Integration with JupiterOne

## NPM + JupiterOne Integration Benefits

- Visualize NPM users, groups, and packages in the JupiterOne graph.
- Map NPM users to employees in your JupiterOne account.
- Monitor changes to NPM users, groups, and packages using JupiterOne alerts.

## How it Works

- JupiterOne periodically fetches users and packages from NPM to update 
the graph.
- Write JupiterOne queries to review and monitor updates to the graph, or leverage
 existing queries.
- Configure alerts to take action when the JupiterOne graph changes, or leverage 
existing alerts.

## Requirements

- JupiterOne requires the name of your NPM organization and an access token API 
interact with the API.
- You must have permission in JupiterOne to install new integrations.
